# What Is Express?
Express uis a fast, unopinionated and minimalist web framework for Node.js

Express is a *server-side* or *back-end* framework. It is not comparable to client side frameworks like React, Angular & Vue. It can be used in combination with those frameworks to build full stack applications.

# Why Use Express?
- Makes building web applications with Node.js much easier.
- Used for both rendered apps as well as API/Microservices
- Extremely light, fast and free.
- Full control of request and response
- By far the most popular Node framework
Great to use with client side frameworks as it's all JavaScript.
